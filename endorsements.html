          <h3>J.D. Roth</h3>
          <h5>Executive Producer/Co-Founder <a href="http://3ballentertainment.com">3 Ball Entertainment</a></h5>
          <p>"We used HANS to direct a VERY complex live big budget show, and he CRUSHED it! I always felt like he was in control, as I watched him in extremely difficult situations direct his way out of trouble and into a perfect shot. I can say with confidence, I will use Hans again and again because his work ethic was impeccable and his dedication top notch!”</p>
      </div>

       <div id="well02" class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3 well well-sm animated bounceInUp">
          <h3>John Montgomery</h3>
          <h5>CEO/Chief Creative Officer at <a href="http://www.thresholdinteractive.com">Threshold Interactive</a></h5>
          <p>"We brought in Hans to work on a very complex branded entertainment project with a very restrictive timeline and budget.  His ability to be nimble and provide a vision and plan that would work within the constraints was incredibly impressive.  He directed a flawless production and the project turned out to be a great success.  I truly look forward to our next project together.”</p>

          <h5>Executive Producer</h5>
          <p>"I’ve had the good fortune of working with Hans on both competition reality and studio game show.  Both projects were in their first season and Hans was a great asset in helping mold the look of each show.  He’s always been a true collaborative director and quite honestly a guy I don’t mind having a beer with after he calls 'wrap'.”</p>

          <h5>Executive Producer</h5>
          <p>"Hans and I first worked together on an insane physical competition series with lots of moving parts.  It was refreshing and comforting to see how well prepared he is.   More importantly was how adept he was at adjusting on the fly on tape day in the best interest of the show.  I also appreciated his ability to see the whole show and provide the editors with a lot to work, ultimately resulting in a better show.”</p>

          <p>"I had the pleasure of being an Executive Producer of a game show pilot that Hans directed. He was, from beginning to end, professional, prepared, and a true creative collaborator. (He's also a nice guy and easy to work with.)</p>
          <p>He delivered a wonderful looking product under an extremely limited rehearsal and production schedule. I wholeheartedly recommend Hans, and know he'll be a tremendous asset to any TV production.”</p>

          <p>"I have had the great pleasure to work with this creative visionary on several projects, the last of which was an extension of a Proctor and Gamble classic titled <em>The People's Choice Game</em>. Hans brought his masterful eye to an ambitious format, to help establish an innovative visual style that defined the show.</p>
          <p>The Flying Dutchman is a tireless worker and natural leader. His command of the studio crew was articulate and efficient. It was an honor to serve with him in the production trenches and I offer my highest recommendation.</p>
          <p>Don’t hesitate for a moment...
          Hans is your man... he's also a phenomenal skier."</p>
