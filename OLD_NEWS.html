            A critical view on daily news by the very funny John Henson. Four half hour pilots for Debmar-Mercury that hopefully will lead to a daily syndicated show in fall 2019.

             The 2018 Laver Cup was the second edition of the Laver Cup, a men's tennis tournament between teams from Europe and the rest of the world. I directed the Amazon integration of the international feed.

            	Who doesn't remember <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/double-dare-reboot-taps-youtube-star-liza-koshy-as-host-1113637">Double Dare</a>, the iconic game show series from the 80s that made the Nickelodeon network what it is now? Well, a reboot is in the works and the new series will premiere on June 25th 2018. I'm glad to get a chance to put my touch on this show and make it ready for the 21st century.

            	Recently, I directed Black Card Revoked, hosted by Tony Rock. Based on the popular party game, this 12 episode comedy game show series offers a lighthearted test of knowledge of pop culture from an African American perspective. Black Card Revoked is produced by Alternative Productions for BET, with David Hurwitz serving as executive producer. Premiere was January 10, 2018.
